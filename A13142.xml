            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13337:38"/> ruled &amp; gouerned 300. yeares, or there about, by Kinges, Princes and Dukes, Idolators and Infidels. namely by the Va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dales, by the Gothes, by the Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, by the Aſtrogothes, by the Viſigothes, and by the Lumbards in ſuch ſort, that during the ſpace of 700. yeares or there about, after the incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt there was no Emperour, Kinge, nor Prince of Rome, which would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the law of Ieſus Chriſt. The which gladly and ſhortly I haue declared, to the end that the Reader thinke not ſtrange, that I haue heere ſhewed the ſacrifice of the maſſe, to haue taken his beginning of the ancient religion inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Numa Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pilius</hi> more then 700. yeares before the incarnation of Chriſt.</p>

Ieſus Chriſt the euerlaſting ſacrificer, was he alone at the Altar, eating one litle round hoſt grauen full of Images, when he celebrated the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of his body?

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13337:90"/> for the triall and confirmation of our faith: is this an occaſion to play the Capharnaits or the Nicodemianes to doubt of the power of God, how is it poſſible to eate the body and drinke the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt?

Then ſeeing wee haue a promiſe giuen vnto vs by the word of God, wherefore (O Maſſalians) haue ye imagined a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tranſubſtantiation, miſtruſting the incomprehenſible power of God, ought it not to ſuffice you to beleeue ſimply that the body &amp; bloud of Ieſus Chriſt is offred vnto vs really &amp; ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally to communicate for our nouriſhment, and to giue vs euerlaſting life by the bread and wine conſecrated with giuing of thankes the bread being truely his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and the wine his bloud, which ought to be receiued worthily by faith, and in purenes of conſcience, as holy ſignes and markes of the godly badge, without enquiring euer ſubtilly the meanes, otherwiſe then Ieſus Chriſt hath

If it were otherwiſe, this ſhould not be called a ſacrament but a myracle, as when Ieſus Chriſt, turned the water into wine, that he vſed a miracle of tranſubſtantiation, changing water into wine. But he did not then ordeine a ſacrament as he did of the communion of his body &amp; bloud by the holy figures of bread and wine.

For euery one is an hypocrite &amp; wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and euery mouth ſpeaketh follie. Therefore by the wrath of the Lord of hoſtes ſhall the land bee darkned, and the people ſhall bee as the meate of the fire. No man ſhall ſpare his brother, for wickednes burneth as a fire, it deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the briars and the thornes, and will kindle in the thick places of the forreſt, and they ſhall mount vp like the lifting vp of ſmoke: and when he ſhall looke to the earth, behold trouble, and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vexation, and anguiſh: yet for all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtil. Woe vnto them that decree wicked decrees, and write greeuous things to keepe backe the poore from iudgement, and to take away the iudgement of the poore, that widowes may bee their pray, and that they may ſpoyle the fatherles.

For they tranſgreſſe the lawes, they changed the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and brake the euerlaſting couenant. Therefore hath the curſe deuoured the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are deſolate, the inhabitants of the land are burned vp, and few men are left; and hee that flieth from the noyſe of the feare ſhall fall into the pit; and he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out of the pit ſhall be taken in the ſnare, for the windowes from an high are open, and the foundations of the earth doe ſhake, the earth is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly broken downe.

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:13337:142"/> ſhall be heauy vpon it, ſo that it ſhall fall and riſe no more. No man calleth for iuſtice, no man contendeth for the truth, they truſt in vanity, and ſpeake vaine things, they conceiue miſchiefe, and bring forth iniquity, for their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are defiled with bloud, and their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with iniquitie: their lips haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lies, and their tongue hath murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red iniquitie: they runne to euill, and they make haſte to ſhed innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bloud: their thoughts are wicked thoughts; deſolation and deſtruction is in their paths, the way of peace they know not, and there is no equitie in their goings: they haue made them croked pathes, whoſoeuer goeth therein ſhall not know peace: therefore iudgement turneth backward, and iuſtice ſtandeth farre off, for truth is fallen in the ſtreets, and equitie cannot enter, yea truth fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and he that refraineth from euill, maketh himſelfe a pray.

Wherefore gird you with ſackcloth, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and houle, for the fierce wrath of the Lord is not turned back from vs. I beheld, and lo the fruitful place was as a wilderneſſe, and all the cities thereof were broken downe at the preſence of the Lorde, and by his fierce wrath. For thus hath the lord ſaid, the whole land ſhalbe deſolate: yet will I not make a full end; and when thou ſhalt be deſtroied, what wilt thou doe? Thy waies and thine inuentions haue procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee theſe things, ſuch is thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Therefore it ſhalbe bitter, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall pierce vnto thine heart: for my people is fooliſh, they haue not
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13337:144"/> knowen me, they are fooliſh children, and haue no vnderſtanding, they are wiſe to doe euil, but to doe well they haue no knowledge. Then ſaid I, ah Lord GOD, ſurely thou haſt deceiued this people, ſaying, ye ſhall haue peace, and the ſword pierceth vnto the heart. They haue denied the Lord, and ſaid it is not hee, neither ſhall the plague come vppon vs, neither ſhall wee ſee, ſword nor famine. O Lord are not thy eies vpon the trueth? Thou haſt ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, but they haue not ſorrowed, thou haſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed them, but they haue refuſed to receiue correction. They haue made their faces harder then a ſtone, and haue refuſed to returne. How ſhould I ſpare thee for this? Thy children haue forſaken me, and ſworne by them that are no gods: though I fed them to the full, yet they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adulterie, &amp; aſſembled themſelues by companies in the harlots houſes. They roſe vp in the morning like fed horſes, for euerie man neighed after his
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:13337:145"/> neighbours wiſe; ſhall I not viſite for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? Lo I will bring a nation vpon you from farre, O houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the lord, which is a mightie nation, and an ancient nation, a nation whoſe language thou knoweſt not, neither vnderſtandeſt what they ſay; whoſe quiuer is an open ſepulcher, they are all very ſtrong, and they ſhall eate thine harueſt; and thy bread they ſhall deuoure thy ſonnes &amp; thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they ſhall eate vp thy ſheepe, and thy bullocks, they ſhall eate thy vines and thy fig-trees; they ſhal deſtroy with the ſword thy fenced citties wherein thou diddeſt truſt. For amongſt my people are ſound wicked perſons that laieth waite as hee that ſetteth ſnares, they haue made a pit to catch men. As a cage is full of birds: ſo are their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes full of deceit, thereby they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come great and waxen rich, they are waxen fatte and ſhining, they do ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the deedes of the wicked, they execute no iudgement, no not the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:13337:145"/> iudgement of the fatherles, yet they proſper, though they execute no iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the poore. An horrible and filthy thing is committed in the land the Prophets prophecie lies, and the Prieſts receiue giftes in their hands, &amp; my people delight therein. Shall not I viſit, for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? or ſhall not my ſoule be auenged on ſuch a nation as this? Truſt not in lying words, ſaying, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, this is the temple of the Lord: behold you truſt in lying words that cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. But this thing commanded I them, obey my voice, &amp; I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people, and walke you in all my waies which I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, that it may bee well vnto you. But they would not obey nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their eare, but went after the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and ſtubbornneſſe of their wicked heart, and went backward and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Therefore ſhalt thou ſpeake all theſe wordes vnto them, but they will not heare thee. Thou ſhalt alſo cry vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:13337:146"/> them, but they will not anſwer thee: but thou ſhalt ſay vnto them, this is a nation that heareth not the voice of the Lord their GOD, nor receiueth diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, truth is periſhed &amp; cleane gone out of their mouth. Therfore thus ſaith the Lord, behold mine anger and my wrath ſhall be powred out vppon this place, vpon man and vpon beaſt, and vpon the tree of the field, and vppon the fruit of the ground, and it ſhall burne and not be quenched, and the carkaſes of this people ſhall bee meate for the ſowles of the heauen and for the beaſts of the earth, and none ſhall fray them away, and death ſhall be deſired rather then life of al the reſidue that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth of this wicked familie, which remaine in all the places where I haue ſcattered them, ſaith the lord of Hoſtes. How doe you ſay we are wiſe, and the lawe of the lord is with vs? lo, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in vaine made he it, the penne of the ſcribes is in vaine, the wiſe men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, they are affraid and taken: lo
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:13337:146"/> they haue reiected the word of the lord, and what wiſedome is in them? Therefore will I giue their wiues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, and their fields vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhall poſſeſſe them: for euerie one from the leaſt to the greateſt is giuen vnto couetouſneſſe, and from the Prophet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Prieſt, euerie one dealeth faſlly, for they haue healed the hurt of the daughter of my people with ſweete words, ſaying, peace, peace, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no peace: for behold I will ſend ſerpents and cockatrices amongſt you which will not be charmed, and they ſhall ſting you, ſaith the lord. Oh that my head were full of water, and mine eies a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the ſlaine of the daughter of my people. Oh that I had in the wildernes a cottage of way-faring men, that I might leaue my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and go from them, for they be all adulterers, and an aſſemblie of rebels, and they bend their tongues like their bowes for lies; but they haue no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:13337:147"/> for the truth vpon the earth, for they proceed from euill to worſe, and they haue not knowne mee ſaith the lord. Let euerie one take heede of his neighbour, and truſt you not in any brother, for euery brother will vſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and euerie friend will deale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, and euery one will deceiue his frend and will not ſpeake the truth, for they haue taught their tongues to ſpeake lies, and take great paines to do wickedly. Thine habitation is in the midſt of deceiuers, becauſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite they refuſe to know me, ſaith the lord. Therefore thus ſaith the lorde of hoſtes, behold, I will melt them, &amp; try them, for what ſhall I elſe doe for the daughter of my people? their tongue is an arrowe ſhot out, and ſpeaketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt; one ſpeaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but his hart he layeth waite for him. Shall I not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them for theſe things ſaith the lord? or ſhall not my ſoule be auenged on ſuch a nation as this? Therefore thus
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:13337:147"/> ſaith the Lord God of Hoſtes, the God of Iſrael, behold, I will feede this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with wormewood, and giue them waters of gall to drinke, for death is come vp into our windowes, and is entred into our palaces, to deſtroy the children without and the yong men in the ſtreetes. Speake, thus ſaith the lord, the carkaſes of men ſhall lie euen as the dung vpon the field, and as the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full after the mower, and none ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them. Thus ſaith the Lord, let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſedom, nor the ſtrong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glory in his ſtrength, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth and knoweth me; for I am the Lord which ſhew mercie, iudgement and righteouſneſſe in the earth, for in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord, learne not the way of the heathen, &amp; be not afraid for the ſignes of heauen, though the heathen be afraid of ſuch. Euery man is a beaſt by his owne knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:13337:148"/> for the paſtors are become beaſts, and haue not ſought the lord, therfore haue they no vnderſtanding, and all the flocks of their paſtures are ſcattered. O Lord, I know that the way of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not in him ſelfe, neither is it in man to walke, and to direct his ſteps. O Lord, correct me, but with iudgement, not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, power out thy wrath vpon the heathen that know thee not and vpon the families that call not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy name: let me ſee thy vengeance on them, for vnto thee haue I opened my cauſe. O lord, if I diſpute with thee thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous, yet let me talke with thee of thy iudgements; wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper? why are all the in wealth that rebelliouſly tranſgreſſe? Thou haſt planted them, and they haue taken roote, they grow and bring forth fruit, thou art neare in their mouth, &amp; farre from their reines: O lord thou haſt ordeined them for iudgement, and O GOD thou haſt eſtabliſhed them for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:13337:148"/> correction. Giue glory to the lord your God before hee bring draknes, and or euer your feete ſtumble in the darke mountains, and whiles you looke for light he turneth it into the ſhadowe of death and make it as darkenes. But if you will not heare, this my ſoule ſhall weepe in ſecret for your pride, &amp; mine eie ſhall weepe and drop downe teares, for the crowne of your glorie ſhal come downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your heads. O lord though our iniquities teſtifie againſt vs, deale with vs according to thy name, for our rebellions are many, we haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the. O the hope of Iſrael, the ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our thereof in the time of trouble, why art thou as a ſtranger in the land, as one that paſſeth by to tarry for a night? why art thou as a man aſtonied, &amp; as a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man that cannot helpe? yet art thou, O lord in the middeſt of vs, &amp; thy name is called vpon vs; O forſake vs not. Thus ſaith the lord vnto this people, thus haue they delighted to wander, they haue not refrained their feete. Therfore
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13337:149"/> hath the lord no delight in them, but he will now remember their iniquitie, and viſit their ſinnes: when they faſt I will not he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wee acknowledge, O lord, our wickednes, and the iniquitie of our fathers, for wee haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, do not abhorre vs for thy names ſake, caſt not downe the throne of thy glory, remember and breake not thy couenant with vs. Are there any among the vanities of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that can giue raine, or can the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens giue ſhowers? is it not thou O lord our God? Therefore will we waite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, for thou haſt made all theſe things. Then ſaid the lord vnto me, though <hi>Moiſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſtoode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, yet mine affection could not be towards this people. Caſt them out of my ſight, and let them depart: and if they ſay vnto thee, whither ſhall wee depart? then tell them, thus ſaith the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:13337:149"/> lord, ſuch as are apointed to death, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death; &amp; ſuch as are for the ſword, to the ſword; and ſuch as are for famine, to the famine; &amp; ſuch as are for the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, to the captiuitie: and I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ouer them foure kindes, ſaith the Lord; the ſword to ſlay, and the dogs to teare in pieces, and the fowles of the heauen, and the beaſts of the earth to deuoure, and to deſtroy. Thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, ſaith the lord and gone back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; therfore will I ſtretch out my hand againſt thee, and deſtroy thee, for I am wearie with repenting. Thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and thy treaſures will I giue to be ſpoiled without gaine, and that for all thy ſinnes, euen in all thy borders. Behold, ſaith the lord, I will ſend out many fiſhers, and they ſhall fiſh them; and after I will ſend out many hunters, and they ſhall hunt them from euerie mountaine, and from euery hill, &amp; out of the caues of the rocks: for mine eies are vppon all their waies, they are not hid from my face, neither is their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:13337:150"/> hid from mine eies. And firſt I will recompence their iniquitie &amp; their ſinne double, becauſe they haue defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my land, and haue filled my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance with their filthy carrions and their abhominations. Thus ſaith the lord, curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and withdraweth his heart from the lord, for he ſhall be like the heath in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, &amp; ſhall not ſee when any good commeth: but ſhall inhabite the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched places in the wildernes in a ſalt land, and not inhabited. Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the lord, and whoſe hope the lord is, for he ſhall be as a tree that is pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the water, which ſprea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth out her rootes by the riuer, &amp; ſhall not feele when the heate commeth, but her leafe ſhall be greene and ſhall not care for the yeare of drouth, neither ſhal ceaſe from yielding fruit. The heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue all things, who can know it? I the lord ſearch the heart, and try the reines euen to giue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:13337:150"/> man according to his waies, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fruit of his workes. As the partrich gathereth the yong which ſhe hath not brought forth ſo he that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth riches, and not by right, ſhall leaue them in the middeſt of his daies, and at his end ſhall be a foole. O Lord the hope of Iſrael, all that forſake thee ſhalbe confounded, they that depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee ſhall bee written in the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue forſaken the Lord the fountaine of liuing waters. Heale me, O Lord, and I ſhall be whole, ſaue me, and I ſhall be ſaued, for thou art my praiſe. Then the word of the Lord came vnto me ſaying, I wil ſpeake ſodainly againſt a nation, or againſt a kingdome to pluck it vp, and to roote it out and to deſtroy it, but if this nation, againſt whom I haue pronounced, turne from their wickednes, I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring vppon them. And I will ſpeake ſodainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a nation &amp; concerning a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to build it, and to plant it: but if
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:13337:151"/> it doe euill in my ſight, &amp; heare not my voice, I will repent of the good that I thought to doe for them Thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſtes, the God of Iſrael, behold I will bring vpon this citie and vpon all her towns, all the plagues that I haue pronounced againſt it, becauſe they haue hardned their necks &amp; would not heare my words; but they ſaid deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, ſurely wee will walke after our owne imaginations, and doe euery man after the ſtubbornnes of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart. Behold, I will bring a plague vpon this place, the which whoſoeuer heareth it, his eares ſhall tingle, and I will cauſe them to fall by the ſword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their enemies, &amp; by the hand of them that ſeeke their liues, and their carkaſes will I giue to bee meate for the ſowles of heauen, and to the beaſtes of the field, and I will feed them with the fleſh of their ſonnes, and with the fleſh of their daughters, and euery one ſhal eate the fleſh of his friend, in the ſiege and ſtraitneſſe wherewith their
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:13337:151"/> enemies that ſeeke their liues ſhall hold them ſtrait. Woe bee vnto the paſtors that deſtroy &amp; ſcatter the ſheep of my paſture, ſaith the Lord. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael vnto the paſtors that feede my people, ye haue ſcattered my flocke, and thruſt them out, and haue not viſited them. Behold I will viſit you for the wickedneſſe of your workes, ſaith the Lord: for both the Prophet and the Prieſt doe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and their wickednes haue I found in my houſe, ſaith the Lord: wherfore their way ſhall be vnto them as ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waies in the darkenes, they ſhall bee driuen forth, and fall therein: for I will bring a plague vpon them, euen the yeare of their viſitation, ſaith the Lord. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Prophets, behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drinke the water of gall: for from the Prophets is wickednes, gone forth into all the land of Ieruſalem, they ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en alſo the hands of the wicked, that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:13337:152"/> none can returne from their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: they are all vnto me as Sodome, &amp; the inhabitants thereof as Gamorah. They ſay ſtill vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that diſpiſe me, the Lord hath ſaid, ye ſhall haue peace, and they ſay vnto euery one that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the ſtubbornnes of his owne heart, there ſhall no euill come vpon you. Therfore behold, I euen I will vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forget you, and I will forſake you and bring an euerlaſting reproch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you, and a perpetual ſhame which ſhall neuer bee forgotten. I haue not ſent theſe Prophets; ſaith the Lord, yet they ran; I haue not ſpoken vnto them, and yet they prophecied. But if they had ſtood in my counſell, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my words vnto my people, then they ſhould haue turned them from their euil way, and from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes of their inuentions. How long doe the Prophets delight to prophecie lies, euen prophecying the deceit of their owne heart. Is not my word like a fire, ſaith the Lord, and like a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13337:152"/> that breaketh the ſtone? Therfore behold, I will come againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaith the Lord, which haue ſweet tongues, and ſay, he ſayeth, behold, I will come againſt Prophets ſaith, the Lord, that ſteale my word, euery one from his neighbour: behold I wil come againſt them that prophecie falſe dreames, ſaith the Lord, and doe tell them, and cauſe my people to erre by their lies and by their ſlatteries, and I ſent them not, nor commanded them: therfore they bring no profit vnto this people, ſaith the Lord. For thus hath the Lord God of Iſrael ſpoken vnto me, take the cup of wine of this my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at my handes, and cauſe all the nations to whom I ſend, to drinke it, and they ſhall drinke and be moued, and be mad, becauſe of the ſword that I will ſend amongſt them. Therefore ſay thou vnto them, thus ſaith the lord of hoſts the God of Iſrael, drinke &amp; be drunk, &amp; ſpew, &amp; fall &amp; riſe no more, becauſe of the ſword which I will ſend<pb n="318" facs="tcp:13337:153"/> amongſt them: but if they refuſe to take the cup at thine hand to drinke, then tell them, thus ſaith the lord of hoſtes, you ſhall certainly drinke; for loe, I begin to plague the citie where my name is called vpon, and ſhould you goe free? you ſhall not goe quit. For I will call for a ſword vpon all the inhabitants of the earth, ſaith the lord of hoſtes. The Lord ſhall roare from aboue, and thruſt out his voice from his holy habitation, hee ſhall roare vpon his habitation, and crie aloud, the ſound ſhall be to the ends of the earth, for the Lord hath a controuerſie with the nations, and will enter into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all fleſh, and hee will giue them that are wicked to the ſword, ſaith the lord. Thus ſaith the lord of hoſts, behold, a plague ſhall goe forth from nation to nation, and a great whirle-wind ſhall be raiſed vp from the coſtes of the earth, and the ſlaine of the lord ſhal be at that day, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth: they
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:13337:153"/> ſhall not bee mourned, neither gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor buried; but ſhalbe as the dung vpon the ground. Thus my ſoule was farre off from peace, I forgat proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, remembring mine affliction, and my mourning, the wormwood, and the gall, my ſoule hath them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and is humbled in me. It is the Lords mercies that wee are not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe his compaſſions ſaile not. The Lord is my portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith my ſoule, therefore wil I hope in him. The Lord is good vnto them that truſt in him, &amp; to the ſoule that ſeeketh him. It is good both to truſt, and to waite for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord. It is good for a man that he beare the yoke in his youth, for the Lord wil not forſake for euer, but though hee ſend affliction, yet wil he haue compaſſion, according to the multitude of his mercies: for he doth not puniſh willingly, nor afflict the children of men in ſtamping vnder his feete all the priſoners of the earth. Wherefore then is the liuing man ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull?
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:13337:154"/> man ſuffereth for ſinne. Let vs ſearch &amp; trie our waies, &amp; turne againe to the lord. Let vs lift vp our hearts with our hands vnto God in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. Wee haue ſinned and haue rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, therfore thou haſt not ſpared: thou haſt couered vs with wrath and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vs, thou haſt ſlaine, &amp; not ſpared. Thou haſt couered thy ſelfe with a cloud, that our prayer ſhould not paſſe thorow: thou haſt made vs as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring and refuſe in the middeſt of the people; al our enemies haue opened their mouth againſt vs. Feare and a ſnare is come vpon vs, with deſolation and deſtruction; the ioy of our heart is gone, our dance is turned to mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: therefore our heart is heauie: for theſe things our eyes are dimme. The crowne of our head is fallen; woe now vnto vs that we haue ſinned.</p>
               <p>O thou ſonne of man, behold they ſhall put bands vpon thee, and ſhall bind thee with them, and thou ſhalt not goe out amongſt them, and I will

Can their hart endure; or can their hands bee ſtrong in the dayes that I ſhall haue to doe with thee?

Therefore ye ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards heare the word of the Lord: As I liue ſaith the lord God, ſurely becauſe my flock was ſpoiled and my ſheepe were deuoured of all the beaſts of the field, hauing no ſhepheard, neither did my ſhepheards ſeeke my ſheepe: but my ſhepheards fedde themſelues, and fed not my ſheepe.

               <hi>A ſhort exhortation and dialogue,</hi> ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that Chriſt is to all true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians life and ioy, and that death is</hi> their aduantage.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is good that we haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times griefes, ſicknes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities; for they driue a man to behold himſelfe, and to ſee that he is heere but as an exile in impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; baniſhment, wanting heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light, in a world and valley of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, couered with darknes and ſhadow of death, where a man is oft times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fouled with ſin, encumbred with paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſquieted with dreads, bounden with charges, buſied with vanities, blinded with errors, ouercharged with labours, vexed with temptations, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with delights and pleaſures of the world and of the fleſh, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly tormented, ſomtimes with ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, penury and need: in which world there are alſo diuers kindes of Diuels, which do nothing day and night, but
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:13337:173"/> range vp and downe, ſeeking whom they may deuoure, whoſe continuall care and onely deſire is to deuoure the ſoules whom God hath created, who whether we ſleepe or wake, eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer we do elſe, lie in wait for vs night and day, by all meanes, by all ſubtilty and craft, now openly, now couertly, aiming at vs with their poiſoned arrowes to deſtroy our ſoules. Behold they haue laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite traps to take and entangle our feet, and all our waies haue they filled with ſnares to catch our ſoules; they haue laid ſnares in riches, ſnares in pouerty, ſnares in meate, ſnares in drinke; in pleaſures ſnares, in ſleepe ſnares, in watching, ſnares: they haue laid ſnares in our words, ſnares in our workes, and ſnares in all our waies; and yet ſuch is our extreame madneſſe, that albeit we do continually behold theſe Dragons before our eies, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mouth, prepared to deuour vs; yet neuertheleſſe we ſnort and ſport
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:13337:173"/> in our ſecurity &amp; careleſnes, as though we were ſafe before them, who deſire nothing, but our deſtruction: Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to murther vs watch alwaies &amp; ſleep not, and we ſleepe and watch not for our ſaluation, as one temptation goeth, another commeth, &amp; the cauſe is, for we haue loſt our innocencie. It is maruaile therefore that any man can be merry in this life, if he conſider well how farre he is baniſhed out of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly country, and in how great perill to periſh euerlaſtingly his ſoule ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: but through lightnes of heart, &amp; negligence of our defaults wee feele not, nay we will not feele the ſorrowes of our owne ſoule, but oft-times wee laugh, when we ought rather to weep, and mourne: for there is no perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, nor true ioy, but in the feare of God, and in a good conſcience: neuer giue thy ſelfe to any manner vndiſcreet mirth, for no maner of thing, as nigh as thou maieſt haue done, ſorrow for thy ſinne, and meditate continually on
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:13337:174"/> thy mortality and death, according to the counſell of <hi>Salamon</hi> in his booke of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> Remember now thy Creator in the daies of thy youth, while the euill daies come not, nor the yeares approch wherin thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them, whiles the ſunne is not darke, nor the light, nor the moone, nor the ſtarres, nor the cloudes returne after the raine: when the keepers of the houſe ſhall tremble, and the ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelues and the grinders ſhall ceaſe becauſe they are few, &amp; they waxe darke that looke out by the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and the doores ſhall be ſhut without, by the baſe ſound of the grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and thou ſhalt riſe vp at the voice of the bird, &amp; the daughters of ſinging ſhall be abaſed: and thou ſhalt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide of the high thing, and feare ſhal be in the way, and the Almond tree ſhal flouriſh, and the Graſhopper ſhall bee a burden, and concupiſcence ſhall bee driuen away: while the ſiluer corde is not lengthned, nor the golden ewre
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:13337:174"/> broken, nor the pitcher broken at the well, nor the wheele broken at the ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and duſt returne to the earth, as it was, and the ſpirit returne vnto God that gaue it; For man ſhall go to the houſe of his age, he ſhall lie downe and be quiet, he ſhall ſleep and be at reſt, the eye that hath ſeene him, ſhall ſee him no more, and his eye ſhall returne to ſee no more pleaſure: for as the cloud vaniſheth and goeth away, ſo he that goeth downe to the graue, ſhall come vp no more, he ſhall returne no more to his houſe, neither ſhall his place know him any more: for he ſhal go and ſhall not returne, euen to the land of darknes and ſhadow of death ſhall he go, into a land, I ſay, darke as darknes it ſelfe, and into the ſhadow of death, where there is no order, but the light is there as darknes, and the iuſt and the wicked ſhall ſleep together in the duſt, and the wormes ſhall couer them, they ſhall be brought vnto the graue, and they ſhall remaine in the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:13337:175"/> heap, the graue ſhall be their houſe, and they ſhall make their bed in the darke, they ſhall ſay vnto corruption, thou art our father, and to the worme, thou art our mother, and our ſiſter, and the ſlimy valley ſhall be ſweete vnto them, and the worme ſhall feele their ſweetnes. There ſhal the wicked ceaſe from their tyranny, and they that haue laboured valiantly ſhall be at reſt, there ſhal the priſoners reſt together, &amp; heare no more the voyce of the oppreſſor, there ſhalbe ſmall and great, and the ſeruant ſhalbe free from his maſter, and euery man liuing ſhal draw after them, as before there were innumerable: wee ſhall bee brought all vnto death, and to the houſe appointed for all the liuing; For in the hand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie is the ſoule of euery liuing thing, and the breath of all mankinde: the daies of man are determined, &amp; the number of his monethes are with him, hee hath appointed him as bounds, which he cannot paſſe, &amp; man knoweth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:13337:175"/> not the houre of his death: for when his fleſh is vpon him, he ſhalbe ſorrowful, &amp; while his ſoule is in him it ſhal mourn but when death ſhal come, then he ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, and riſeth not: for he ſhall not wake againe, nor be raiſed from his ſleep, vntill the heauens be no more. For all ſhall go to one place, all was of the duſt, &amp; all ſhall returne to the duſt. But though after our skins, wormes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this body, yet ſhal we ſee God in our fleſh, whom we our ſelues ſhall ſee, and our eies ſhall behold and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for vs, though our reines be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed within vs, for our redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the earth, and he ſhall bring euery worke to iudgment, with euery ſecret thought whether it be good or euill. Therfore take away griefe, anger and enuie out of the heart, and cauſe euill to depart from thy fleſh, &amp; thinke oft on the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, in the 9. to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues.</hi> It is appointed vnto all men that they ſhall all once die, and after that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:13337:176"/> commeth the iudgement. So Chriſt was once offred to take away the ſins of many, and vnto them that looke for him, he ſhall appeare the ſecond time vnto ſaluation; for we muſt all appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, that euery man may receiue the things that he hath done in his body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done in his body; according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or euill. This death the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto which all fleſh ſhal come, is either an entrance, or gate to perpetual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pleaſure, or to perpetual priſon and paine: the death which maketh entrance to euerlaſting paine is termed Ghoſtly, and the ſicknes which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the ſame is alſo Ghoſtly: which Ghoſtly ſicknes and infection procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the malice of Satan, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our owne wicked nature, driuing all of whom it taketh hold ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to errour in religion, errour in life, or errour in both. Of errour in life, the booke of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:13337:176"/> Seeke not death in the errour of your life, deſtroy not your ſelues through the workes of your owne hands. And of errour in religion it is ſpoken in the 106. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and 39. verſe. Thus were they ſteined with their owne workes, &amp; went a whooring with their owne inuentions. The like wherof is affirmed in the 2. Epiſtle of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> where it is ſaid, He that tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God, he that continueth and abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Sonne; which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and leſſon our Sauiour had taught before in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi> the 15. chapter, and the 9. verſe. And in vaine do they worſhip mee, teaching doctrines &amp; commandements of men: as do all the heatheniſh idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Iewes, Infidels, Turks, Heretikes &amp; Miſcrea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which do worſhip falſe gods or honour and ſerue the true God after a falſe manner, according to the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and commandements of men,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:13337:177"/> embracing doctrines and traditions for the worſhip and ſeruice of God, more then are deliuered in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the word of God, and ſome alſo contrary to the ſame, according as doth the Court or Church of Rome, and all the company of Catholike Papiſts, diſciples and followers of the Court and Church of Rome, which ghoſtly ſicknes, infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of errour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, errour in life, or errour in both, bringeth with it euerlaſting death both of body and ſoule, if the infected truely penitent, renouncing and deteſting all his former errours, both of religion &amp; life, be not waſhed, purged, and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the pretious bloud of Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God; &amp; ſo through Gods mercifull grace and goodneſſe gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his beloued ſonne bee forgiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and fully pardoned of the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloud nothing can be made cleane, and the bloud of Chriſt ſhal cleanſe our conſcience from all ſin, It is then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:13337:177"/> for you and all others that looke and hope for ſaluation, to beleeue and hold ſtedfaſtly vnto your liues end, the true holy Catholike and Chriſtian faith, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marily in the articles of our beleefe, according as the ſame hath bin of ancient time gathered and drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the ſcriptures of the old &amp; new teſtament, the holy writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God, and is more amply and large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in thoſe holy bookes, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things taught in thoſe bookes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for a Chriſtian man to inſtruct him fully, perfectly, and ſufficiently in the way to euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Do you then truely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feynedly beleeue that all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the true worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and for the inſtruction and guiding of your ſoule in the right knowledge of the way to euerlaſting life and ſaluation, are ſufficiently and fully contained and taught in the holy written word of God, of the old and new Teſtament, and will you heartily
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13337:178"/> and vnfeinedly renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce al other faiths, worſhip and ſeruice of God, not being moſt truely conteined and taught in thoſe holy bookes?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>I beleeue and embrace that faith, worſhip and ſeruice of God, conteined and taught in the holy books aforſaid, as only &amp; fullie ſufficient through the grace of Gods ſpirit, to inſtruct and teach my ſoule in the way to euerlaſting life: and I do heartilie &amp; vnfeinedlie renounce all faithes, worſhip and ſeruice of God, more then that, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that which is moſt truelie and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie taught and deliuered in thoſe holie bookes of the old and new Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reioice then and be of good comfort that god doth giue you grace to beleeue and hold ſtedfaſtly the true ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Chriſtian faith of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, contained and fully taught in the holy bookes oforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Qu. Do you as all true beleeuers &amp; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, confeſſe according as you are taught in gods holy word, that you haue not ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the time of your life paſt ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Anſw. <hi>I confeſſe it.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. Haue you an earneſt deſire, and ſtedfaſt purpoſe through the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Gods grace to amend your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life paſt, and to lead a new life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods holy will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, all the reſt of your daies, that God ſhall grant you life?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>I do earneſtlie deſire it, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God who is the giuer of all goodnes to direct me by his grace ſo to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. Do you truely, vnfainedly and ſtedfaſtly beleeue that Chriſt the Son of God, and ſauiour of the world hath
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:13337:179"/> died and ſhed his bloud for you, and hath by his death and the ſhedding of his moſt precious bloud waſhed and cleanſed your ſoule from ſinne, &amp; giuen vnto the ſame by his gracious imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perfect wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification &amp; redemption through himſelfe, that your body and ſoule may be deliuered through the merits of his death from euerlaſting damnation, and obtaine euerlaſting life?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>I beleeue, and I beſeech God of his mercie to helpe mine vnbeleefe, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthen this faith in me vnto my liues end.</hi>

            <p>An. <hi>I am, and I praie God giue me grace ſo to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be of good comfort then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while your ſoule is in you, be thankfull vnto God for this his great mercy beſtowed vpon you, and in the precious death &amp; paſſion of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt put your whole truſt, commit your ſelfe vnto him, and with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious body &amp; bloud, couer your ſoule, and infold and wrap your ſelfe wholly in it, and ſay vnto him after this maner: O my ſweet Sauiour, for this thy names ſake be it vnto me, according to this thy name looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me a ſinful wretch
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13337:180"/> calling vpon thy holy name, and O ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, bee vnto mee a ſauiour for thy names ſake: For ſurely there is no man iuſt in the earth that doeth good, and ſinneth not, neither any that can ſay I haue made my heart cleane, I am cleane from my ſinne. Thou onely art the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all holieſt, and I am the filth of all ſinners: but Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me cleane, ſay thou alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſoule, I wil be thou cleane. Who can tell how oft he offendeth? O clenſe thou me from my ſecret ſinnes. Thou Lord haſt ſaid alſo in the goſpell that the whole neede not the Phyſition, but they that are ſick, and haſt alſo moſt gratiouſly bidden vs to come vnto thee when we feele our ſelues trauailed and heauie loaden, ſaying in moſt ſweete and comfortable words, <hi>Come vnto mee all ye that trauaile and are heauie loaden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> I come therefore vnto thee becauſe of thy ſweet bidding, ſore trauailed and loaden with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of my ſinnes which are ſo heauie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:13337:180"/> me, that I am not able to looke vp, yea they are more in number then the haires of my head, and my heart hath failed me, but Lord let it bee thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to deliuer me, make haſt O Lord to help me, for I am ſore charged, and cumbred with many euil temptations, my heart is alſo intangled and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with many euil paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which come of my fleſh, of the world, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and there is none that can help me or deliuer mee, nor that can make mee free and ſafe, but only thou my Lord God, my onley ſauiour, to whom, I commit me. Refreſh me which am ſo trauailed, lighten me which am ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened; thou art the moſt ſoueraigne phyſition, and my ſoule is alſo ſore ſick in ſinne, heale mee which come to bee made whole through thee, the ſicker that my ſoule is, the more deſire it hath to be healed, and the more neede hath it of thee. Turne not thy face away therefore from me, neither caſt thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant away in diſpleaſure, leaue me not,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:13337:181"/> neither forſake me O God of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: for why? in healing the deadly ſicknes of my ſoule ſhall well be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commended the greatnes of thy goodnes that wilt helpe and heale ſo wretched a creature: if thou receiue me into the large boſome of thy mercy, the place wil not be the more ſtraitned, or leſſened by me. It is true Lord that I haue ſinned, and in the whole courſe of my life haue multiplied many offences, and no repentance or puniſhment of my ſelfe may ſuffice to ſatisfie thy iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But I humbly beſeech thee to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue me O Lord, forgiue me, &amp; deſtroy me not with my tranſgreſſions, bee not angry with me for euer by reſeruing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for me, neither condemne me into the euerlaſting damnation of hell dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and paines prepared for the Diuel and his angels, for thou art the God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the God of them that repent, and in me thou wilt ſhewe all thy goodnes, for ſure it is that thy mercies are endleſly more then mine offenſes, and though
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:13337:181"/> my tranſgreſſions are infinite, yet more infinite are thy mercies. Therefore if thou ſhalt enter into iudgement with me thy poore and vnworthy ſeruant, I wil lay before thee the rich righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy beloued ſonne Ieſus Chriſt my ſauiour, which hee hath purchaſed &amp; giuen vnto me by his precious death: I will lay his righteouſnes giuen vnto me betweene my ſoule and thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, otherwiſe Lord I may not, nay I dare not contend with thee, for thine angry threatnings towards ſinners are importable, but thy mercifull promiſes are vnmeaſurable and vnſearchable, for thou art the moſt high Lord of great compaſſion, long ſuffering, and moſt mercifull. Thou Lord according to thy great goodnes haſt promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and forgiuenes to them that ſinne againſt thee, and for thine infinit mercies haſt appointed repentance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinners that they may bee ſaued; I therefore a moſt wretched ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my manifold ſinnes, &amp; earneſtly
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:13337:182"/> repent me of my former wickednes and vngodly behauiour towards thee, and all my chriſtian brothers &amp; ſiſters gone before me, or remaining ſtill in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent worlde, for I haue ſinned againſt heauen and againſt thee, and I am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne; &amp; though for mine vnworthines I am not able of my ſelfe to purchaſe thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don hauing beene thy prodigal &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtful childe which haue waſted all the ſubſtance of my life in ſinne, &amp; am fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to great wretchednes, yet I beſeech thee bleſſed Lord to looke vpon mee with the eies of thy pitie, and receiue me in the reioicings of peace, and grant me the bleſſings of forgiuenes, and do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wickedneſſe that I haue done, that I may appeare cleane vnto thee, as thou madeſt me, and receiue mee againe into fauour; and if thou anſwere vnto my Soule, thou haſt deſerued damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Lord I confeſſe that I haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the number of the ſand of the ſea, and my tranſgreſſions are exceeding
